# Building Transformers
Run the following command once the repository has been cloned
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## BERTMaskedLM
You can train the BERTMaskedLM model built by running the following command
```bash
python train.py
```
Or you can load the pre-trained weigths using
```python
bert = BERTMaskedLM(config=config, vocab_size=vocab_size)
bert.load_state_dict(torch.load("../weights/bert_masked_lm.pt",
                                map_location=torch.device(device=device)))
```
After training for 30 epochs the model was able to achieve an accuracy of **88.58%** and a loss of **0.4307**. The results are shown below<br><br>

## PoemGPT
PoemGPT is a decoder-only transformer model that generates poems similar to that of Shakespeare's
You can generate poems by running the following command in the terminal
```bash
python gen_poem.py --num_tokens <num_chars in poem>
```
```
